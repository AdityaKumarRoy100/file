  <h2>MOON</h2>
  <h1>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and our closest celestial neighbor. It's about a quarter the size of Earth and is made of similar rocks. The Moon has no atmosphere, which means there's no wind or weather to erode its surface. This is why astronaut footprints from the Apollo missions are still there today. The Moon's gravity affects Earth's tides, creating high and low tides in our oceans. One side of the Moon always faces Earth; this is called tidal locking. The far side, once called the "dark side," isn't actually always dark - it gets sunlight too, we just can't see it from Earth. The Moon has many craters from asteroid and comet impacts. It also has large, dark areas called maria, which are ancient lava flows. Scientists think the Moon formed when a Mars-sized object hit early Earth, throwing out material that eventually clumped together. The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth at about 3.8 centimeters per year. Despite being our closest neighbor, we still have much to learn about the Moon.</h1>
