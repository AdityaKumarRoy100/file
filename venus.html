  <h2>VENUS</h2>
  <h1>Venus, often called Earth's twin due to its similar size and mass, is a planet of extremes. Its thick atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide, traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures averaging 462°C (864°F). This scorching heat is hot enough to melt lead. Venus rotates on its axis in the opposite direction of most planets, a phenomenon known as retrograde rotation. A day on Venus is longer than its year; it takes 243 Earth days to complete one rotation but only 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun. The planet's surface is hidden beneath thick clouds of sulfuric acid, which create a reflective blanket making Venus the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon. Despite its harsh conditions, Venus's upper atmosphere has regions with Earth-like temperatures and pressures, leading some scientists to speculate about the possibility of microbial life there. The planet's surface features numerous volcanoes and deformed mountains, evidence of its geologically active past and possibly present.</h1>
