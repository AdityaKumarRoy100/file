  <h2>NEPTUNE</h2>
  <h1>Neptune, the outermost known planet in our solar system, is an ice giant similar in composition to Uranus. It has a deep blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. Neptune is the windiest planet, with speeds reaching up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph). It hosts a storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, called the Great Dark Spot, though it's more transient. Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest being Triton, which orbits the planet backwards and is likely a captured Kuiper Belt object. The planet also has faint, clumpy rings. Neptune's existence was mathematically predicted before it was observed, due to irregularities in Uranus's orbit. It was discovered in 1846, becoming the first planet located through mathematical calculations rather than direct observation. Like Uranus, Neptune has only been visited once by a spacecraft, Voyager 2, in 1989. Recent Hubble Space Telescope observations have revealed dynamic weather patterns on Neptune, including rapidly forming and dissipating dark spots. Despite being so far from the Sun, Neptune radiates more energy than it receives, the mechanism for which is not fully understood.</h1>
