  <h2>URANUS</h2>
  <h1>Uranus, the third-largest planet in our solar system, is an ice giant composed primarily of water, methane, and ammonia ices surrounding a rocky core. Its blue-green color comes from methane in its upper atmosphere absorbing red light. Uranus is unique among the planets because it rotates on its side, likely due to a collision with an Earth-sized object early in its history. This tilt causes extreme seasons lasting 20 years each, with the sun shining continuously for 84 Earth years at the poles. Uranus has 27 known moons, all named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. It also has a faint ring system, discovered in 1977. Despite being visible to the naked eye, Uranus wasn't recognized as a planet until 1781 when William Herschel observed it with a telescope. Only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, has visited Uranus, flying by in 1986 and providing most of our close-up data about the planet. Recent observations suggest that Uranus might have active auroras and may be releasing X-rays.</h1>
