  <h2>MARS</h2>
  <h1>Mars, often called the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance, has long fascinated humans as a potential abode for life. It's about half the size of Earth and has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide. Mars hosts the largest known volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a canyon system, Valles Marineris, that dwarfs Earth's Grand Canyon. The planet's surface features impact craters, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps composed of water ice and dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide). Evidence suggests Mars once had liquid water on its surface, with features resembling dried-up riverbeds and lake basins. Today, water exists primarily as ice in the polar caps and underground. Mars experiences seasons due to its axial tilt, similar to Earth. Dust storms can grow to cover the entire planet, lasting for months. The planet has two small, irregularly shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos. Numerous missions have explored Mars, including rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance, which are currently studying its geology and searching for signs of past microbial life.</h1>
