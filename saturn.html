  <h2>SATURN</h2>
  <h1>Saturn, famous for its stunning ring system, is the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like Jupiter, it's a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn's rings, visible from Earth through a small telescope, are made primarily of water ice and rock fragments ranging in size from tiny grains to boulder-sized chunks. The planet has at least 82 moons, with Titan being the largest and the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere. Enceladus, another of Saturn's moons, has geysers of water erupting from its south pole, suggesting a subsurface ocean that could potentially harbor life. Saturn's density is so low that it would float in a bathtub large enough to hold it. The planet's atmosphere features bands similar to Jupiter's, but they're less pronounced and more pastel in color. Saturn's hexagonal storm at its north pole is a unique feature in the solar system. Despite its size, Saturn has the shortest day of any planet, rotating once every 10.7 hours. The Cassini mission, which ended in 2017, provided invaluable data about Saturn, its rings, and moons.</h1>
