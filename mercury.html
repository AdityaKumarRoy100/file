  <h2>MERCURY</h2>
  <h1>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling our Moon. Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, with daytime temperatures soaring to 430째C (800째F) and nighttime temperatures plummeting to -180째C (-290째F). Despite this, there's evidence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters at its poles. Mercury has no moons and no substantial atmosphere. It completes an orbit around the Sun every 88 Earth days, but due to its slow rotation, a single day on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days. The planet has a large iron core, making up about 60% of its mass. This core generates a magnetic field, albeit much weaker than Earth's. Mercury's surface is composed mainly of silicate rocks and metals. The planet has been visited by two spacecraft: NASA's Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER, which orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015, providing detailed maps and data about the planet's composition and structure.</h1>
